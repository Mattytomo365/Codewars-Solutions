## Overview

This repository contains a collection of sucessfully completed coding challenges (Katas) from the Codewars platform, I'm using this platform to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my coding quality and style, and continue developing as a programmer through hands-on practice.

## Completed Katas

### 1. ASCII Hex Converter (Python)

This is my first challenge on this platform, I wasn't really sure where to start, so I decided to choose an area I am familiar with, hexidecimal.

The importance of code efficiency was highlighted to me with this task, as I now recognise that **both** functions could be reduced to only contain a singular line of code.

### 2. Pernicious Numbers (C#)
I hadn't coded in C# in months, so I decided to challenge myself by completing my next task using C#. It was both challenging and fun to switch languagees in such a short amount of time.

From this task, I learnt alot about the configuration of C# projects, particularly how files like `.csproj` and `launch.json` are essential for debug configurations. This sparked my curiosity, prompting me to explore online resources and research different debug configurations (e.g. C#: Launch Startup Project), different types of projects (e.g. Executable (`.exe`), Library (`.dll`)), and the .NET/.NET Core frameworks.
