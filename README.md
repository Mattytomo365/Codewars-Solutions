## Overview

This repository contains a collection of sucessfully completed coding challenges (Katas) from the Codewars platform, I'm using this platform to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my coding quality and style, and continue developing as a programmer through hands-on practice.

## Completed Katas

### 1. ASCII Hex Converter (Python)

This is my first challenge on this platform, I wasn't really sure where to start, so I decided to choose an area I am familiar with, hexidecimal.

The importance of code efficiency was highlighted to me with this task, as I now recognise that **both** functions could be reduced to only contain a singular line of code.

### 2. Pernicious Numbers (C#)
I hadn't coded in c# in a few months, so I took it upon myself to complete my next project in c#. It was challenging and fun to switch language in such a short amount of time.

From this task, I learnt alot about the configuration of c# projects, and how files like .csproj are necessary for debug configurations. This prompted me to seek online courses covering this area, allowing me to fill gaps in my knowledge.
