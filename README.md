## Overview

This repository contains a collection of sucessfully completed coding challenges (Katas) from the Codewars platform, I'm using this platform to sharpen my problem-solving skills, improve my coding quality and style, and continue developing as a programmer through hands-on practice.

## Completed Katas

### 1. ASCII Hex Converter (Python)

This is my first challenge on this platform, I wasn't really sure where to start, so I decided to choose an area I am familiar with, hexidecimal.

The importance of code efficiency was highlighted to me with this task, as I now recognise that **both** functions could be reduced to only contain a singular line of code.

### 2. Pernicious Numbers (C#)

I hadn't coded in C# in months, so I decided to challenge myself by completing my next task using C#. It was both challenging and fun to switch languagees in such a short amount of time.

From this task, I learnt alot about the configuration of C# projects, particularly how files like `.csproj` and `launch.json` are essential for debug configurations. This sparked my curiosity, prompting me to explore online resources and research different debug configurations (e.g. C#: Launch Startup Project), different types of projects (e.g. Executable (`.exe`) and Library (`.dll`)), and the .NET/.NET Core frameworks.

### 3. Digital Root (Java)

Java was the last language I had experience with which I hadn't utilised, so I completed the next Kata using Java.

This task reiterated key best practices with Java, such as certain naming conventions around class names and package names, along with the use of packages themselves, allowing for the organisation of classes into different namespaces.

This task also highlighted the importance of recursion, and how simple, yet effective it is to use. I was trying to use several loops for this program, when recursion was the simple solution. I will look into more tasks that require the use of recursion.
